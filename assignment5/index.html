                <font face="Arial" size="3">We source our coffee beans from local and international farmers who practice sustainable farming, ensuring that every cup of coffee served supports environmentally sound practices. By engaging directly with these farmers, we not only guarantee the quality and freshness of our coffee but also support fair trade practices that benefit farming communities.</font>

                <font face="Arial" size="3">Our coffee shop reduces waste by using biodegradable cups and packaging, and we encourage our customers to bring their own reusable cups by offering a discount on their coffee. We have also implemented a composting program that repurposes coffee grounds and organic waste from our kitchen into compost that enriches local community gardens.</font>
